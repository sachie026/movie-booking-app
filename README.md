# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Tech stack

## How it works

- Mocked movies and seats data are stored on a mock server and URL is used to fetch them
- User can see movies list, movie details, can select the time and available seats.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
